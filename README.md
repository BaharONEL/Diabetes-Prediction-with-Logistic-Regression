# Diabetes-Prediction-with-Logistic-Regression

## Business Problem
When the characteristics are specified, people with diabetes be able to predict whether they are sick or not.
Can you develop a machine learning model?

## Dataset Story
The dataset is part of a large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases in the USA.
Data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city of the State of Arizona in the USA.
It consists of 768 observations and 8 numerical independent variables.
The target variable is specified as " outcome "; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.

## Variables
* Pregnancies – Number of pregnancies
* Glucose – Glucose : 2-hour plasma glucose concentration in the oral glucose tolerance test
* SkinThickness – Skin Thickness
* Insulin – 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: – Function :2-hour plasma glucose concentration in the oral glucose tolerance test
* Age – Age (years)
* Outcome: Have the disease (1) or not (0)

## Study Purpose
Literature search, data preprocessing and feature engineering develop a diabetes prediction model by realizing .
